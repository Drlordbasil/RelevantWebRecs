# Autonomous Web Content Aggregator and Recommender

The Autonomous Web Content Aggregator and Recommender is a Python-based AI project that operates entirely autonomously to gather, analyze, and recommend relevant web content to the user. The project utilizes search queries using the Requests library to fetch URLs from search engine results pages (SERPs) without hardcoding any specific URLs. With the help of tools like BeautifulSoup or Google Python library, it extracts valuable information from webpages to generate curated content recommendations.

## Description

The Autonomous Web Content Aggregator and Recommender is designed to provide users with a seamless experience of consuming curated web content. By utilizing AI techniques such as web scraping, natural language processing, and recommendation engines, this Python-based project eliminates the need for users to manually search for content and instead delivers tailored recommendations based on their interests and preferences.

## Key Features

1. **Search Query Automation:** The program uses search queries provided by the user to fetch webpages from search engine results using the Requests library. By dynamically generating search queries based on user preferences and trends analysis, the program ensures a constant flow of fresh and relevant content for aggregation and recommendation.

2. **Web Scraping and Parsing:** Using tools like BeautifulSoup, the program scrapes the fetched webpages to extract key information such as article headlines, summaries, keywords, and URLs. It then parses and cleans the extracted data to ensure its accuracy and readability.

3. **Content Aggregation and Curation:** The program aggregates the collected content from different webpages, filtering out duplicates and organizing it based on various criteria such as topic, date, and relevance. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and group similar articles, blog posts, or social media updates. This ensures a coherent and diverse collection of curated content for the user.

4. **Content Recommendation Engine:** Leveraging HuggingFace small models or similar NLP models, the program analyzes the collected content and user preferences to generate personalized content recommendations. It considers factors such as the user's previous engagement, interests, and trends to recommend the most relevant and engaging content.

5. **In-Built Failsafes:** The program incorporates failsafes to ensure proper operation and safety. It includes exception handling mechanisms to handle connection timeouts, invalid URLs, or any other errors that may occur. Additionally, the program implements authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure secure access and data handling.

6. **Auto-Updating and Self-Maintenance:** The program periodically checks for updates to its dependencies, AI models, and collects user feedback to continuously improve its recommendations. It can autonomously download and update necessary resources from the web to ensure it operates with the latest information and techniques.

7. **User Interaction and Feedback:** The program provides a user-friendly interface where the user can input search queries, view curated content, and provide feedback. The program incorporates user feedback and engagement metrics to further refine its recommendations and content selection algorithms.

8. **Performance Monitoring and Reporting:** The program tracks various performance metrics, including content relevance, user engagement, and recommendation accuracy. It generates comprehensive reports that provide insights into content performance, audience preferences, and monetization potential. These reports help the user make data-driven decisions to optimize their online presence and monetization strategies.

## Installation

To install and run the Autonomous Web Content Aggregator and Recommender project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/web-content-aggregator.git`
2. Install the required Python packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

To use the Autonomous Web Content Aggregator and Recommender, follow these steps:

1. Import the required libraries:
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
import numpy as np
```
2. Define the `WebPage` class and its methods:
```python
class WebPage:
    def __init__(self, url, text):
        self.url = url
        self.text = text
        self.content = []

    def scrape_content(self):
        soup = BeautifulSoup(self.text, 'html.parser')
        articles = soup.find_all('article')
        for article in articles:
            # Extract relevant information such as headline, summary, keywords, and URL
            # Append the extracted information to self.content
```
3. Define the `WebContentAggregator` class and its methods:
```python
class WebContentAggregator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.search_queries = []
        self.webpages = []

    def add_search_query(self, query):
        self.search_queries.append(query)

    def fetch_webpages(self):
        # Fetch webpages for each search query using Requests library
        # Append the fetched webpages to self.webpages

    def scrape_content(self):
        # Scrape content from each webpage using BeautifulSoup
        # Call the scrape_content() method of each WebPage object in self.webpages

    def deduplicate_content(self):
        # Remove duplicate content from self.webpages based on URL

    def recommend_content(self, user_preferences):
        # Implement content recommendation logic based on user preferences and collected content
        # Return a list of recommended content

    def run(self):
        # Trigger the execution of the main program flow
        # Fetch webpages, scrape content, deduplicate, ask for user preferences, generate recommendations
        # Print or display the recommendations to the user
```
4. Create an instance of the `WebContentAggregator` class, add search queries, and run the program:
